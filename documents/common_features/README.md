# Common Features Documentation

This directory contains documentation for features that are shared across multiple factories in the ICTO V2 system.

## Directory Structure

```
common_features/
├── pipeline/           # Pipeline-related documentation
├── version_management/ # Version management system documentation
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Purpose

Instead of creating standalone documentation files that don't follow the project's factory-based structure, common features are organized here with proper README and CHANGELOG files.

## Documentation Standards

- Each subdirectory should have its own README.md
- Each subdirectory should have a CHANGELOG.md for tracking changes
- Documentation should be interconnected with factory-specific docs
- Follow the same patterns as factory-based documentation
