## Overview

The Launchpad Factory module provides a comprehensive token launchpad solution for the Internet Computer ecosystem. It enables projects to create, manage, and execute token sales with automated liquidity provision, vesting contracts, and fund allocation management. The system supports multiple governance models for post-launch asset management.

### Key Features

- âœ… Multi-step Token Launch Process
- âœ… Automated Token Contract Deployment
- âœ… Multi-DEX Liquidity Provision (ICPSwap, KongSwap, Sonic DEX, ICDex)
- âœ… Vesting Schedule Management
- âœ… Raised Funds Allocation (Team, Marketing, Liquidity)
- âœ… Post-Launch Asset Management Options
  - ðŸš§ DAO Treasury Transfer
  - ðŸš§ Multisig Wallet Transfer
- âœ… Real-time Allocation Validation
- âœ… Industry Standard PinkSale-style Allocations

## Governance Models

The Launchpad Factory supports three governance models for post-launch asset management:

### 1. DAO Governance Model

**Overview:** Decentralized autonomous organization with proposal-based governance system.

**Features:**
- Token holder voting on proposals
- Automated treasury management
- Proposal submission and voting periods
- Quorum-based decision making
- Transparent audit trail on blockchain

**Use Case:** Best for community-driven projects requiring decentralized governance.

**Asset Flow:**
```
Launchpad â†’ DAO Treasury â†’ Proposal Voting â†’ Automated Execution
```

### 2. Multisig Wallet Model

**Overview:** Multi-signature wallet controlled by core team members with configurable thresholds.

**Features:**
- M-of-N signature requirements (e.g., 2/3, 3/5)
- Core team control for quick decision making
- Asset custody with multiple approvals required
- Signer management and threshold adjustments
- Transaction history and audit logging

**Use Case:** Ideal for startups and teams needing efficient governance while maintaining security.

**Asset Flow:**
```
Launchpad â†’ Multisig Wallet â†’ Multi-signature Approval â†’ Asset Release
```

### 3. No Governance Model

**Overview:** Direct asset distribution without additional governance layers.

**Features:**
- Simplest deployment model
- Direct asset transfers to recipients
- No overhead governance structure
- Fastest deployment time

**Use Case:** Suitable for projects with simple distribution requirements.
